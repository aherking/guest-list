# guest-list
Planning with ease by planning easy. The Guest List Guru keeps your guests in 'check'.  
This is the Ultimate Guest List App for all your planning needs!

Simple set up: 

-Using the console of your choice ( I like bash!) clone the app using:
  -git clone https://github.com/deetriplett/guest-list
  
-Then 'cd' into the root directory: guest-list
  -cd guest-list
  
-Install packages and dependencies you'll need to run the app
  -npm install 

-Start up Mongodb (with windows you must navigate to Mongodb's bin folder and open up the mongod console)

-Use node to start up the app. While in the guest-list directory, in your console, type:
  -node index.js
  
  -If successful, the console log will read :
   Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica...and server is running on port 8080!
   Success! Connected to Mongodb!

-Open your preferred browser and go to localhost:8080

-Begin planning your dream event!
